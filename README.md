# Budgtr - A Financial Transaction Management Application

Budgtr is a full-stack web application that allows users to efficiently manage their financial transactions. This application is built using JavaScript, React, RESTful routes, and a server, providing users with the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a single resource. The application's user-friendly interface and thoughtful design make it easy to log and organize financial data.

## Features

### 1. User-Friendly Navigation

Budgtr features a consistent navigation bar across all pages, which includes the name of the application and a button to create a new resource. This ensures a seamless user experience and easy access to key functions.

### 2. Index Page

The Index page provides an overview of all the resources in your database table. Users can easily view and manage their financial transactions from this centralized location.

### 3. Show Page

When you click on a specific resource, you are directed to the Show page. Here, you can access more detailed information about the selected resource, helping you to get a clear understanding of your financial data.

### 4. Create New Resource

The "Create New Resource" button in the navigation bar allows you to add a new financial transaction. The corresponding page includes a well-labeled form with appropriate input types to ensure accurate data entry.

### 5. Edit Resource

On the Show page, you can edit the details of the current resource. Clicking the "Edit" button directs you to a pre-filled form that can be edited. After submitting the edited resource form, the changes are saved in the database.

### 6. Delete Resource

The Show page also features a "Delete" button, allowing you to remove the current resource from your records. This provides a straightforward way to manage your financial data.

### 7. Real-Time Calculation and Visual Feedback

Budgtr performs calculations on the front-end, allowing users to see important financial metrics, such as the bank account total. The application's CSS changes based on the total value: green for totals above 100, yellow for totals between 0 and 100, and red for totals less than 0. This visual feedback helps users quickly assess their financial situation.
